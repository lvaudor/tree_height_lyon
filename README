This script aims at producing raster data that corresponds to tree or shrub height in Lyon (FR) and surrounding areas (Lyon metropole).

It calculates a Digital Height Model based on several kinds of raw input data, all provided by the OpenData platform (data.grandlyon.com).

It uses the R software and lidR package.

The output data is provided as rasters with resolution 50cm (data/vegetation_height_50cm).

The script tree_height_lyon.R also shows how these rasters can be aggregated into a single raster with resolution 2m (not provided here as it exceeds gitHub's limit in size for a single file).
